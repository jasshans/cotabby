/// File overview:
/// Rules for text a host holds uncommitted ("marked") in the focused field.
///
/// Two hosts-side features produce marked text. macOS inline predictive text (Sonoma and later,
/// on by default) shows the system's own gray completion right after the caret in every
/// NSTextView: TextEdit, Notes, Mail, Messages. Input methods compose text before the caret. Both
/// spans are reported in `AXValue` like committed text, with the selection sitting at the caret,
/// so a naive reader sees "text after the caret changed" and drops the live suggestion, then a
/// regeneration paints a second gray completion over the system's one (measured live in TextEdit:
/// typing "ju" made the host show "mps", Ghostype invalidated its own " jumps over" tail, and the
/// re-shown card landed on top of the host prediction).
///
/// The policy is to treat the marked span as the host's: it is not part of the committed text
/// Ghostype reasons about, and while it is on screen Ghostype stays out of the way.
///
/// Web hosts draw their own predictions into the page instead, where no marked range names them:
/// Chromium's address bar selects its completion (see `FocusSnapshotResolver`), and Gmail writes
/// its Smart Compose suggestion into the compose body (`smartComposeSuggestionRange`).

    /// The span of Gmail's Smart Compose suggestion after the caret, or nil. Gmail writes its gray
    /// suggestion and a "tab" key hint on the line below it into the editable text, so
    /// Accessibility reads both as text after the caret: in a Gmail compose body (2026-09-11) it
    /// read "lot of time\ntab", " and running\ntab", and "the app\ntab" then "he app\ntab" once its
    /// "t" was typed. Read as the user's own text, it made every caret at a line's end look mid-line: the
    /// ghost gave way to the card, and Ghostype's suggestion competed with Gmail's for the same spot
    /// and the same Tab key. The span runs from the caret through the hint; anything after that
    /// line (a signature) stays the user's. Only on Gmail, where the shape was measured, and only
