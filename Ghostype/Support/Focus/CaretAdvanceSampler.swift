/// File overview:
/// Measures how wide the host really renders its text by watching the caret move as the user
/// types: between two focus polls on the same line, the characters that arrived and the distance
/// the caret travelled are one width sample of the host's own glyphs.
///
/// Why this exists: `HostTextMetricsProbe` asks the host for the rendered width of the text before
/// the caret, and a Chromium contenteditable answers nothing. The only size such a host reports is
/// the CSS font size, which knows nothing about page or Electron zoom: the Claude desktop composer
/// reported 14 while painting its face at 15.4 (110% zoom, measured 2026-09-10 from the caret's
/// own movement, `hostadv.py`), so the ghost was drawn a tenth too small, its typed-through pens
/// drifted off the host's caret, the leading space visibly collapsed, and the tail left after an
/// accepted word landed on the inserted text. The caret is the one width the host cannot misreport:
/// after "the " it sits exactly one "the " further right, in the host's real face at the host's
/// real size. `GhostFontResolver` scales its stand-in face to this sample exactly as it would to
/// the probe's, so the ghost's advances match the host's whatever the reported size says.
///
/// Rules, all measured against Chromium's behavior:
///   - only a caret that is a measured glyph position counts (an exact one, or one derived from
///     character bounds); an estimated one is a guess about the field, and one placed inside a run
///     by its share of the run's characters spreads the run frame evenly over them, so both are
///     simply skipped, never reset on: CodeMirror's polls alternate between the two (Obsidian,
///     2026-09-10), and resetting on every such poll left the field without a sample for good;
///   - an observation extends the running sample only when it is on the same line (a wrap or a new
///     paragraph moves the caret to another y), the caret did not move backward, the document
///     caret grew by a keystroke's worth (`maximumStep`) and the text before the new characters
///     still ends the way it did (a window that slid, a backspace or a pasted block all fail this
///     and start over); a poll that saw no change at all (most polls) changes nothing;
///   - a character whose poll shows no caret movement is held back until the caret moves: a
///     space typed at the end of a line hangs with no advance until the next letter, and a host
///     can publish a keystroke's text a poll before its caret box (measured in Chrome's
///     contenteditable, 2026-09-10: the first twelve-character sample was one advance short,
///     eight percent, and the ghost rendered at 13.7 for a 15px field); the held text joins the
///     next chunk whose advance covers it, so text and width always describe the same glyphs;
///   - the other order holds too: a caret box that moves before its keystroke's text is published
///     keeps that movement for the text that follows, once. Reading it as an edit started the
///     sample over with the character still to come, which then took the next character's
///     advance: every chunk paid one character late, and the sample held one more character than
///     its width covered (Chrome's contenteditable, 2026-09-10: "i Sarah, thanks for s" measured
///     131.0 for 135.3, which read as a face 3% narrow and briefly matched Avenir Next);
///     the sample is offered once it holds `minimumLength` characters;
///   - the sample is trimmed to its newest `maximumLength` characters by whole chunks, so an
///     early integer-rounded caret position weighs less as the evidence grows;
///   - a non-breaking space reads as a space: Chromium stores a space typed at the end of a line
///     as U+00A0 and turns it into U+0020 once the next character arrives, which would otherwise
///     break the text's continuity at every word (measured 2026-09-10: no sample ever formed in a
///     Chrome contenteditable, 389 presentations without one).
