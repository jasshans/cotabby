/// File overview:
/// Remembers, for each host text style, the face and size the last field there settled on, so the
/// next field in the same host starts in it instead of in the size the host reports.
///
/// Why this exists: a field settles its face from evidence it has to collect first, a caret width
/// sample of a dozen characters on one line or a pixel strip with enough ink. Until then a field
/// that names no face renders the reported size. Claude's composer reports 14 and paints Anthropic
/// Sans at 15.4, so every new message began with ghosts a tenth too small that grew once the
/// evidence arrived (measured 2026-09-10 in a ProseMirror-style page modelled on the composer: the first 26 to 77
/// presentations of every field at 14, then 15.2 to 15.9). A host sets the same text the same way
/// from one field to the next, so the last settled face is the best evidence a new field has, and
/// the field's own match replaces it as soon as it has one.
///
/// The same holds for the host's line pitch. A web engine's caret box is the glyph box, not the
/// line box, so a wrapped ghost row on a paragraph's first line (no line above to measure) stepped
/// down by the caret height: 19pt in Claude's composer, whose lines are 23pt apart, four points
/// high. The last pitch a field of the same style measured is the host's line-height.
///
/// Keyed by what makes two fields the same text style: the app (and, for a browser, the page
/// origin, since two sites share nothing), the size the host reports, the caret box height, and the
/// user's size multiplier. A value type in `Support/`; `OverlayController` owns the one instance
/// for the app's lifetime and keeps it across launches (`encoded()`, `init(restoring:)`): the first
/// field after a launch had nothing to start from, and Obsidian's showed the caret box's 17pt for
/// three seconds of typing before its pixel match named the 16pt system face (2026-09-11).
