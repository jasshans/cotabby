/// File overview:
/// The host's text size, read from where its own caret lands as the user types along a line.
///
/// Why this exists: a host that reports no font size is sized from a pixel match of a short strip,
/// and that strip's size search is coarse until the strip holds enough text for its advance fit. A
/// match that scores well is settled and never measured again. Claude's Code composer is the
/// measured case (2026-09-11): the match settled on Anthropic Sans at 15.1585 from thirteen
/// characters, where the host paints its 14px at the app's 1.0954 zoom, 15.336, and every ghost ran
/// short by a point and a half over a line, for the field's life.
///
/// Every caret the pixels measure on a paragraph's first line lies on one straight line:
/// `caretX = lineStart + scale × advance(text before the caret)`, with the advance taken in the
/// ghost's face. The slope is the host's size over the face's; that session's 23 captures across
/// 500pt gave 15.339. The slope is Theil–Sen's (the median of the pairwise slopes), because a
/// capture can read the host a glyph early or late: five of those 23 were 3pt off, and a
/// least-squares line through them put the line's start half a point wrong.
///
/// Adoption follows `TypefaceEvidence`'s rule against a size that follows every new capture: the
/// first fit spanning `minimumSpan` is adopted, and only a fit spanning `refinementFactor` times as
/// much replaces it, at most `maximumRefinements` times, so the ghost is resized a few times per
/// field and each time by less.
///
/// A value type owned per field by `OverlayController`; the captures come from `PixelCaretLocator`.
