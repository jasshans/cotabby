/// File overview:
/// What a field's accumulated width samples say about its typeface, for hosts that name no face.
///
/// `GhostFontResolver` picks a family by comparing ONE measured width against candidate faces.
/// That is the right call for a field measured once, which is nearly every field. It goes wrong
/// in a field the host keeps re-measuring as it grows, because a single sample cannot tell a
/// coincidental fit from the real face. Measured in Gemini's prompt bar: six samples of one field
/// fitted Georgia, Georgia, Helvetica and Trebuchet in turn (per-character widths swung from 7.4
/// to 9.3pt, which no one font produces), and the ghost changed typeface four times in a sentence.
///
/// Rule, applied only once a field has produced a second, different sample:
///   - the family adopted from the first sample is kept while every later long sample still fits it;
///   - a long sample it fails switches the field, at most once, to a family that fits ALL long
///     samples, the earliest candidate when several do (they then share the face's advances);
///   - if no family fits every long sample, the field is undecidable and settles on the system
///     face scaled to the latest sample, for the rest of the field's life.
/// Short samples (under `minimumEvidenceLength`) are recorded but never decide: three characters
/// of whole-point-rounded width carry more noise than the gap between families.
///
/// Pure value type owned per field by `OverlayController`; nothing here touches AX or the screen.
