/// will occupy once accepted. Every step below prefers a measured fact over a guess:
///
/// 1. A reported PostScript face (`Menlo-Regular`, `.AppleSystemUIFont`) at the reported size.
/// 2. A reported family at the reported size.
/// 3. A reported size with no family (Chromium): the host's rendered width of the text just before
///    the caret is compared against a small candidate set of common web/system faces at that size,
///    and the face whose advances reproduce the measured width wins. With no match, the system face
///    is scaled so its average advance matches the measurement; without a measurement it is used
///    as is.
/// 4. No size at all: the size is solved from the caret box height using the renderer's own line
