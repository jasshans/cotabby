/// File overview:
/// Recognizes a caret the host has not yet moved for text it has already published.
///
/// Why this exists: a Chromium editor publishes a keystroke's text before its caret. Measured
/// 2026-09-11 in Claude's Code composer, the first letter of a message ("K") was in the field's
/// value while the text-marker caret still sat where the empty paragraph began, x 342, in the empty
/// line's 22pt box; the suggestion for "K" arrived before the caret moved and was drawn from it
/// for nine presentations (about 150ms): over the "K" itself, and in the system face at 18.5pt,
/// sized from that 22pt box because no remembered face was filed under it. The next snapshot had
/// the caret after the "K" and everything right.
///
/// The rule: a caret at its line's leading edge while the text before it on that line is not
/// empty cannot be the caret of that text, provided the text is too short to have wrapped (a
/// caret legitimately starts a visual line only at a wrap). Whitespace alone decides nothing, since
/// some hosts collapse a leading space. The presentation waits for the next snapshot instead.
///
/// Pure; `OverlayController` asks it before presenting.
