/// File overview:
/// Reads GPU usage from the IORegistry so the Performance pane can graph it next to CPU and memory.
/// macOS has no public per-process GPU API, but the GPU driver (the `IOAccelerator` service) publishes
/// two things any process may read without special permissions, the same sources Activity Monitor
/// uses:
///
/// - `PerformanceStatistics` on the accelerator: whole-Mac GPU utilization and GPU memory in use.
/// - `AppUsage` on each Metal client the driver opened for a process (a child of the accelerator
///   whose `IOUserClientCreator` reads "pid <n>, <name>"). A process gets one client per Metal
///   device, and the client's `AppUsage` holds one entry per live command queue with that queue's
///   cumulative GPU time. An empty array is a client that has not submitted any work yet.
///
/// Ghostype's own GPU share is therefore the growth of its cumulative GPU time between two readings
/// divided by the time between them. Measured on Apple silicon, `accumulatedGPUTime` is in
/// nanoseconds: a llama.cpp prompt benchmark accumulated 1.84 s of it over 2.01 s of wall time while
/// the device reported 81-99% utilization. Releasing a command queue removes its entry and its time
/// with it (measured with a throwaway queue), so the total can shrink, for example when unloading the
/// model releases llama.cpp's queue.
///
/// Only work Ghostype submits itself is counted. Apple Intelligence generates in a separate system
/// process (a probe saw no GPU client of its own during generation), and an endpoint server such as
/// Ollama is its own process too, so their work never shows up in Ghostype's share.
///
/// Kept in `Support/` beside `SystemResourceSampler`: `SystemMetricsStore` owns the polling cadence,
/// this type only answers "what is true right now", and the parsing and arithmetic are pure static
/// functions so they can be tested without a GPU.

/// One reading of the GPU counters. Every field is optional because a Mac without an accelerator
/// service, or a driver that renames a key, should leave the graph empty rather than show zeros.
