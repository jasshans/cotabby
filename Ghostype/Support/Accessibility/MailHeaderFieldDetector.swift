/// Subject to the body. Measured 2026-09-10 in a live compose window: the model offered " is the
/// email address of the user." after a typed address and "." after a subject, the Tab meant to
/// move on inserted them instead, and the next field's text landed in the same field. Nothing a
/// writer wants completed lives in those fields (addresses come from Mail's own contact
/// completion), so the whole header is left to Mail. Pure: the resolver reads the identifier and
/// asks here.
