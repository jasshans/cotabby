/// File overview:
/// Maps a caret from a Chromium field's range text into its value, where the two disagree about
/// the breaks between blocks.
///
/// A Chromium contenteditable reads out in two coordinate spaces. Its `AXValue` puts a line break
/// between block elements (paragraphs, list items). Its range queries (`AXSelectedTextRange`,
/// `AXStringForRange`) and its text-marker strings run the blocks together, and the caret offset
/// is counted in that run-together space. A break typed with Shift+Return is a character in both.
/// Measured 2026-09-11 in a ProseMirror page modelled on Claude's composer: the value "abc\ndef\nghi"
/// against the range text "abc\ndefghi", the caret at the end reported at 10 of the value's 11.
/// Read in the range space:
///   - the model was handed "here.Se" and continued it as "conde paragraph";
///   - the caret line's text for the pixel match ran back through the paragraphs before it;
///   - the text after the caret came back empty: a window sized from `AXNumberOfCharacters` (the
///     value's length) asks past the range text's end and Chrome answers nil, so a caret in the
///     middle of earlier text read as the end of its line and got an inline ghost over the host's
///     own words.
///
/// Two spots share one range offset: the end of a block and the start of the next ("here.|" and
/// "|Second" are both 26). In the value they sit on either side of the break, and only the host
/// knows which one the caret is at, so the caller answers that (`AXHelper.caretStartsTextBlock`),
/// and is asked only when a break follows the aligned caret.
///
/// Pure and in `Support/` so the alignment, the part of this that is easy to get subtly wrong, is
/// tested without a live Accessibility tree. `FocusSnapshotResolver` owns the one call site.
