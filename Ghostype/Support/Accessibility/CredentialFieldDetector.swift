/// Recognizes sign-in and verification fields (email, username, phone, one-time codes, card
/// numbers) where Ghostype stands down, alongside password fields, which arrive as secure fields
/// and are already blocked by the resolver.
///
/// Why: a completion in "Email or phone" guesses at the user's identity. Accepting one types a
/// wrong address into a login form, and showing one paints a guessed address beside the real one.
/// Nothing in such a field is prose a writer wants continued. Browsers mark only passwords as
/// secure, so these fields are recognized from what the page says about them: its label (title,
/// description, placeholder) and its DOM id, plus the typed text itself looking like an address.
///
/// Scope: single-line fields only (text fields and combo boxes). A multi-line field labelled
/// "email" is an email *body*, which is exactly where completions belong. Pure: the resolver reads
/// the attributes (once per focus session) and asks here on every poll.
///
/// Every signal is matched by whole words or whole id parts, never by raw substring. Blocking
/// costs the writer their completions, so "phonebook-search", "emailSearch" and "Email subject"
/// must stay ordinary fields even though they contain a credential word.
