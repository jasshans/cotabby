/// File overview:
/// The single rule for whether ghost text carries a leading space, evaluated against the text that
/// is in the field RIGHT NOW.
///
/// Why this exists: the normalizer decides the leading space while building the request, from the
/// preceding text as it was when generation started. The user keeps typing during those tens to
/// hundreds of milliseconds, so by the time the ghost appears the decision can be stale in both
/// directions:
///   - the space arrives during generation: the field now ends with a space and the ghost still
///     carries one, so the ghost sits a space too far right and accepting yields two spaces;
///   - a backspace removes the space after the request was built: the ghost has none and accepting
///     glues.
///
/// Whose word boundary it is. A base completion model writes the space itself: its completion is
/// text that follows the request's preceding text exactly, so a completion that starts without a
/// space after a word or a digit continues that word ("1" + "50K" is 150K, "It'" + "s" is It's),
/// and one that starts with a space starts a new word. Measured 2026-09-10 in Claude's composer: a
/// rule that put a space between any two word characters showed "1 50K", "10 0%" and "It' s" over
/// ghosts the model had written joined (66 presentations in fifteen minutes). So when the engine
/// vouches for its spacing (`requestPrecedingText` is given), the completion's own leading space
/// decides, and the live text only removes a space the field already has or restores one the field
/// lost since the request was built. Engines that do not vouch for it (instruct and chat models
/// drop leading spaces) get the word-character rule, with digits and in-word apostrophes joined.
///
/// A word-boundary-anchored request (the user's half-typed word re-anchored at its start, see
/// `WordBoundaryAnchorPolicy`) is decided the same way: what remains after the anchor starts with a
/// space only when the model ended the word there. Measured in the same session: 52 times the user
/// had typed a whole word ("that", "PM"), the model returned " that the timeline…", and a rule that
/// treated every anchored remainder as the rest of the word stripped the space, gluing
/// "thatthe timeline" until the user typed the space and the ghost vanished.
///
/// The rule is a pure function of its inputs, so it can be applied wherever the live text is known
/// (when a result becomes a session, a streamed partial, a prefetched continuation) and always
/// agrees with itself:
///   1. a completion that continues the word before the caret never takes a space;
///   2. a completion opening with closing punctuation never takes a space (", regards" after
///      "Best" is a comma attaching to the word, not a new one);
///   3. otherwise there is exactly one space before a new word, and never a space after whitespace
///      or an opening bracket.
///
/// `Support/` and pure on purpose: the same rule has to hold at generation time, at presentation
/// time and at acceptance time, and it is far easier to trust one tested function than three
/// consistent-looking branches.
