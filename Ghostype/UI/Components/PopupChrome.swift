/// File overview:
/// One shared visual language for every Ghostype surface that floats near the caret: the inline
/// emoji picker, the suggestion "popup" card (mirror mode), and the macro inline preview. Before
/// this they each carried their own `.regularMaterial` + border styling and drifted apart; routing
/// all three through `PopupTheme`/`PopupHUDChrome` keeps them identical and lets a restyle land in
/// one place.
///
/// The look is a *committed-dark* HUD: a deterministic charcoal gradient rather than an adaptive
/// material. Determinism is the point — the popup must read the same dark over a white Pages window
/// as over a black terminal, so it always looks like an ephemeral system overlay instead of a bright
/// card competing with the host document. (An adaptive material would invert to light over a light
/// host, which is exactly the "intrusive bright box" we are moving away from.)
