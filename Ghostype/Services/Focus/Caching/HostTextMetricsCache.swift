/// Caches `HostTextMetrics` per focused element so the handful of bounds queries behind them run
/// once per field, not on every focus poll.
///
/// Two retry paths exist because hosts fail in two different ways:
/// - Chromium loads inline text boxes lazily: the first bounds query after focus returns an empty
///   rect and only later queries answer. An empty answer is retried a bounded number of times,
///   spaced out over successive polls, then given up on so a host that never answers costs
///   nothing more.
/// - A field focused while (nearly) empty has no text to measure a width sample from, yet its
///   line geometry may already be known. Caching that answer as final would pin the field to
///   "no sample" for the whole session, and the typeface match would never improve. A missing
///   sample is therefore re-measured when the caret has moved to a new offset where a sample
///   could exist, again a bounded number of times.
/// - A field with a single line so far has no line pitch to measure (there is no other line to
///   compare against). The pitch is re-measured once the caret has travelled far enough that the
///   text may have wrapped, a bounded number of times, so a ghost can wrap exactly once the host
///   has shown where its second line sits.
///
/// Same lifetime shape as `FieldStyleCache`: a reference type retained by the value-typed resolver.
