/// File overview:
/// Measures the caret's line and x inside a union-framed paragraph from the host's own pixels.
///
/// Where it applies: hosts that expose a wrapped paragraph as ONE static-text run and answer no
/// bounds query for anything inside it (Obsidian's CodeMirror, measured 2026-09-09). For those,
/// Accessibility gives the paragraph's frame and its text and nothing else; the caret used to be
/// laid out inside that frame with an approximated font, which put the ghost five or six points
/// left of the real caret on wrapped lines and, with no sibling runs to calibrate from, on top of
/// the host's own glyphs. The host has already painted the answer: the caret sits where the
/// paragraph's last visual line ends.
///
/// Scope: a caret at the end of its paragraph (the common case while typing) is the end of the last
/// inked line. A caret with text after it on its line gets the card, not a ghost, and the card needs
/// only its line and x: those are found by walking the text before the caret through the painted
/// lines' ink widths (`midLineCaret`), because the host broke its lines where their ink ends.
///
/// The same measurement serves a single-line field that answers no bounds query at all. Chrome's
/// address bar is the measured case (2026-09-10): `AXBoundsForRange` returns a zero rect for every
/// range, the font dictionary is empty, and the only geometry is the field's frame; a text-layout
/// estimate in a guessed font put the caret close, never exactly, and the ghost went to the card.
/// The field paints one line, so its ink's right edge is the caret and the caret box is centred on
/// that ink (`singleLineCaretHeight`).
///
/// Lifecycle: owned by `OverlayController`, one per app. Measurements are cached per field and
/// paragraph text so the many presentations of one suggestion (stability-gate re-presents, the
/// return from a card) reuse one capture; a keystroke changes the text, so the next generation
/// measures again, unless the ghost lies over the run, when the run's last capture is carried
/// forward by the typed text's advance instead (`extrapolatedMeasurement(for:)`). Captures
/// exclude Ghostype's own windows, and an excluded window comes back black, so a ghost on screen
/// is never mistaken for host text and never read through either.
