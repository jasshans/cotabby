/// Makes a host application's *privately bundled* fonts resolvable by name inside Ghostype's process,
/// so ghost text can be drawn in the typeface the user is actually looking at.
///
/// Why this exists as its own boundary: `OverlayController` renders ghost text in the font that
/// `resolveFieldStyle` read out of Accessibility, via `NSFont(name:size:)`. That lookup only searches
/// fonts the *font system* knows about — system fonts plus anything installed in a Fonts directory.
/// Several major hosts never install their fonts at all; they ship them inside their own app bundle
/// and register them process-locally at launch. Microsoft Word is the motivating case: Aptos (its
/// default body font since Office 2024) and Calibri live in
/// `Microsoft Word.app/Contents/Resources/DFonts/` and are absent from every system font directory,
/// so `NSFont(name: "Aptos", size:)` returns nil in our process and ghost text silently falls back
/// to the system font — visibly different from the host's text.
///
/// The fix is to register the one font file we need, from the host app's own bundle, into *our*
/// process. Nothing is installed for the user or the system: `CTFontManagerScope.process` scopes the
/// registration to this running process and it disappears when Ghostype quits.
///
/// Trust: parsing a font is parsing untrusted input, and Ghostype is unsandboxed and holds
/// Accessibility, Input Monitoring and Screen Recording. Both the font name a host reports and the
/// files in its bundle are under that host's control, so an arbitrary focused app must never be able
/// to hand its fonts to CoreText inside this process. Fonts are therefore loaded only from hosts on a
/// short allowlist, and only after the bundle on disk passes a code-signing requirement that pins
/// both its identifier and its publisher (see `hostCodeRequirement`). Everything else keeps the
/// system-font fallback.
///
/// Ownership and lifetime: a single process-wide `shared` instance, because the thing it guards —
/// CoreText's per-process font registration table — is itself process-global. Registering the same
/// URL twice is an error, so the set of already-registered files has to be tracked in exactly one
/// place.
///
/// An `actor` rather than a `@MainActor` type because its steps are blocking work that must stay off
/// the main thread: indexing a bundle's font directory reads metadata from every file (about 180 ms
/// for Word's 281 files), and registration itself is another few ms per file. Serializing through
/// the actor also gives the bookkeeping mutual exclusion for free.
