/// File overview:
/// Measures where a web host really paints its text baseline, from the host's own pixels, so the
/// ghost can sit on it to the device pixel.
///
/// Why pixels: Chromium and WebKit report caret and character boxes through Accessibility rounded
/// to whole points, but they lay lines out at fractional positions (a 1.6 line-height on 18px text
/// puts every line top at a different fraction) and snap the painted baseline to device pixels.
/// `GhostBaselinePolicy` recovers the engine's rounded ascent exactly, yet the fraction the AX
/// rounding discarded still leaves the ghost up to one device pixel off; measured live in Chrome,
/// a textarea's text sat 11.5pt below its 12pt-ascent box top and a contenteditable's second line
/// 16.5pt below a 17pt one. Nothing in AX exposes that fraction. One small capture of the text
/// left of the caret does.
///
/// Cost model: one ScreenCaptureKit screenshot of a strip a few hundred points wide, once per
/// (field, line, font size), started while the model is still generating so the answer is
/// normally cached before the ghost first appears. Screen Recording is optional in Ghostype; without
/// it this service does nothing and the policy baseline stands.
