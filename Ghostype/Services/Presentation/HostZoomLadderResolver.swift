/// Chromium browsers are known by bundle id (`BrowserAppDetector`). An Electron app is known by the
/// framework every Electron app carries in its bundle, `Contents/Frameworks/Electron
/// Framework.framework` (Claude, Obsidian and VS Code on this Mac); no bundle-id list could keep up
/// with them, and the list of Electron editors worth priming is deliberately short. Any other host
/// has no ladder, and its measured sizes stand.

/// Owned by `OverlayController` for the app's lifetime, beside `HostBundledFontRegistry`, which
/// finds a host's bundle the same way. One file-existence check per bundle, cached.
