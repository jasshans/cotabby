/// `SuggestionResult`, so the coordinator, overlay, and acceptance code need no changes to use it.
/// Sitting in front of `SuggestionEngineRouter` also means one check covers every engine, and the
/// live engine kind is read at request time so the endpoint never gets history-derived text.
///
/// Lifetime: built once in `CotabbyAppEnvironment` around the router and owned by the coordinator
/// as its `suggestionEngine`.
