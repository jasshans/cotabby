/// Value types for Ghostype's typing history: the text the user has written in fields Ghostype was
/// active in (recorded on this Mac, or imported from another autocomplete app), and the user's
/// preferences for collecting and using it.
///
/// Why a separate subsystem: history is the only Ghostype data that outlives the field it came from.
/// Everything else in a request (caret text, clipboard, screen) is ephemeral. Keeping these values
/// apart from `SuggestionSettingsModel` lets the history store own its own storage, encryption, and
/// lifecycle, while the suggestion pipeline only sees a narrow read contract
/// (`SuggestionHistoryProviding`).

/// One field's worth of the user's writing.
///
/// A record is updated in place while the user keeps typing in the same field, so a long email is
/// one record rather than one per keystroke. `text` is already scrubbed of secret-like tokens
/// (`TypingHistoryScrubber`) before it is stored.
