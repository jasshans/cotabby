/// because some hosts expose unreliable caret geometry (Electron canvases, certain web editors).
/// Drawing inline ghost text in those hosts produces a "marching" effect as the caret estimate
/// drifts. Mirror mode sidesteps that by rendering the suggestion in a Ghostype-owned card anchored
/// to the input field rectangle, which is much more stable than the caret rect in those apps.
///
/// The enum lives in `Models/` rather than `Support/` because both the policy (which picks the mode)
/// and `OverlayState` (which records which mode the panel is currently in) need to spell out the
/// same case names without depending on rendering code.
