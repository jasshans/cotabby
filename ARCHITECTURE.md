# Ghostype Architecture

This is the ten-minute maintainer map for Ghostype. It explains the product loop, ownership
boundaries, reliability rules, and the best files to read before changing behavior. It is intentionally
a roadmap rather than an encyclopedia.

## What Ghostype Is

Ghostype is a macOS menu bar agent that provides inline autocomplete in other applications:

1. Find the focused editable field through macOS Accessibility.
2. Observe global keyboard input without taking focus.
3. Gate work using permissions, field capability, settings, and runtime state.
4. Build a bounded request from caret text and optional context.
5. Generate through Apple Intelligence, an in-process llama.cpp model, or a user-configured
   OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
6. Normalize the result into a safe short continuation.
7. Render inline ghost text or a mirror card near the caret.
8. Reconcile typing against the active suggestion and insert accepted chunks through configurable
   shortcuts.

The product is local-first, not unconditionally offline. Apple Intelligence and the bundled
open-source path run on the Mac. An endpoint can be loopback, on the local network, or a public HTTPS
service; when selected, the bounded request is sent to that server.

## Architectural Constraints

These rules explain most of the structure:

- There is one app-lifetime dependency graph. Views never create process-wide services.
- Accessibility state is eventually consistent and app-specific. Every async result can be stale.
- Generation, presentation, and insertion fail closed for secure and unsupported fields. Early
  acquisition has a current secure-field caveat described under privacy below.
- User text and optional context are bounded before generation.
- On-device work stays local unless the user explicitly selects an endpoint engine.
- Global input is observed in a fail-open way; Ghostype consumes only events it successfully handles.
- MainActor owns UI, published state, AppKit, and most AX access. OCR, downloads, and generation do
  not block it.
- Mutable native llama state is explicitly serialized and released before process teardown.
- Pure policy belongs outside coordinators so the state machine remains testable.

## Repository Map

- [Ghostype/App](Ghostype/App): application entry point, composition root, lifecycle, and coordinators.
- [Ghostype/UI](Ghostype/UI): SwiftUI and AppKit-facing presentation for settings, onboarding, menus,
  previews, and user surfaces.
- [Ghostype/Services](Ghostype/Services): side-effectful boundaries for AX, event taps, insertion,
  capture/OCR, generation, downloads, permissions, updates, and AppKit panels.
- [Ghostype/Models](Ghostype/Models): shared values, settings, states, configuration, and protocol
  contracts.
- [Ghostype/Support](Ghostype/Support): deterministic rules, prompt rendering, normalization,
  reconciliation, layout, and low-level bridging helpers.
- [GhostypeTests](GhostypeTests): unit tests and microbenchmarks, with emphasis on pure Support and
  Models behavior.
- CotabbyInference: the llama.cpp Swift wrapper consumed from an external SwiftPM package; native
  code is not vendored here. The mid-word anchoring needs a required-prefix constraint that is not in
  `FuJacob/cotabbyinference` main yet, so the package resolves from the `feat/required-prefix` branch
  of the `Mason363/cotabbyinference` fork that adds it; the pin returns to main once it lands there.

[SOURCE_LAYOUT.md](SOURCE_LAYOUT.md) expands this map into the canonical nested source and test
layout. Child folders name stable responsibilities inside a subsystem; they do not create Swift
namespaces or additional build targets.

Folder names describe the dominant responsibility, not the UI framework. Ghostype/UI contains
SwiftUI views, while AppKit panel/window controllers live mostly under Ghostype/Services/Presentation or app
coordinators because they own process-level presentation behavior.

## End-to-End Data Flow

~~~text
CGEvent and focus poll
  -> FocusTracker
  -> FocusSnapshotResolver + AXTextGeometryResolver
  -> FocusSnapshot
  -> SuggestionCoordinator
       -> availability and native correction
       -> debounce + current work identity
       -> SuggestionRequestFactory
            -> bounded AX / surface / clipboard / visual / user context
       -> SuggestionEngineRouter
            -> Apple | in-process llama | OpenAI-compatible endpoint
       -> SuggestionTextNormalizer + seam guards
       -> SuggestionInteractionState
       -> SuggestionOverlayPresenter -> OverlayController
  -> typing reconciliation or configured acceptance
  -> SuggestionInserter
  -> host AX publication check and next prediction
~~~

The request is immutable after generation begins. Engines do not reach back into live AX state.
Before a partial, final, or insertion applies, the coordinator verifies current work identity, focus,
content signatures, settings continuity, and session state.

## Lifecycle and Ownership

Read these first:

1. [CotabbyApp.swift](Ghostype/App/Core/CotabbyApp.swift)
2. [AppDelegate.swift](Ghostype/App/Core/AppDelegate.swift)
3. [CotabbyAppEnvironment.swift](Ghostype/App/Core/CotabbyAppEnvironment.swift)

| Owner | Responsibility | Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CotabbyApp | SwiftUI scenes, MenuBarExtra, AppDelegate bridge | Process |
| CotabbyAppEnvironment | Construct the shared object graph and retain graph-internal subscriptions | Process |
| AppDelegate | Start/stop services and retain lifecycle-driven subscriptions | Process |
| Coordinators | Orchestrate one product surface across services | App or window |
| Services | Own one side effect, OS boundary, or mutable subsystem | Injected |
| Views | Render shared state and send narrow user intents | SwiftUI/AppKit surface |

AppDelegate starts the selected runtime, focus polling, input monitoring, updates, suggestion
coordination, inline commands, and onboarding after launch. It stops new work before tearing down
global taps, polling, and native resources at termination. Production service startup is skipped in
the XCTest host.

CotabbyAppEnvironment also owns important subscriptions: focus cadence, global-toggle tap binding,
power-profile application, engine/model selection, and endpoint connection invalidation. AppDelegate
owns permission reactions, engine runtime start/stop, overlays, model-directory refresh, and
process-lifecycle behavior. Both retain subscriptions because both own different relationships.

[SuggestionSettingsModel.swift](Ghostype/Models/Settings/SuggestionSettingsModel.swift) is the
individually published UI-facing source of app behavior. Its
[SuggestionSettingsData.swift](Ghostype/Models/Settings/SuggestionSettingsData.swift) projection groups
the same values by product domain without replacing the existing API. The immutable snapshot used by
the pipeline is derived from those domains. [SuggestionSettingsStore.swift](Ghostype/Support/Settings/SuggestionSettingsStore.swift)
keeps the established flat UserDefaults keys stable; endpoint credentials live in Keychain.

## Suggestion State Machine

Read the coordinator in this order:

1. [SuggestionCoordinator.swift](Ghostype/App/Coordinators/Suggestion/SuggestionCoordinator.swift)
2. [SuggestionCoordinator+Lifecycle.swift](Ghostype/App/Coordinators/Suggestion/SuggestionCoordinator+Lifecycle.swift)
3. [SuggestionCoordinator+Input.swift](Ghostype/App/Coordinators/Suggestion/SuggestionCoordinator+Input.swift)
4. [SuggestionCoordinator+Prediction.swift](Ghostype/App/Coordinators/Suggestion/SuggestionCoordinator+Prediction.swift)
5. [SuggestionCoordinator+Acceptance.swift](Ghostype/App/Coordinators/Suggestion/SuggestionCoordinator+Acceptance.swift)

The coordinator owns orchestration plus active suggestion and presentation state. It delegates rules
and cohesive mutable sub-state to smaller boundaries:

- [SuggestionAvailabilityEvaluator.swift](Ghostype/Support/Suggestion/Request/SuggestionAvailabilityEvaluator.swift):
  pure permission, settings, focus, and runtime gates.
- [SuggestionRequestFactory.swift](Ghostype/Support/Suggestion/Request/SuggestionRequestFactory.swift): pure bounded
  request construction and the selected backend's developer-debug prompt payload. Nothing is generated
  with the caret inside a token ([CaretTokenPosition.swift](Ghostype/Support/Suggestion/Request/CaretTokenPosition.swift)),
  and on the llama path a request made mid-word is anchored at the word boundary
  ([WordBoundaryAnchorPolicy.swift](Ghostype/Support/Suggestion/Request/WordBoundaryAnchorPolicy.swift)): the partial
  word leaves the prompt (so its last token is a whole word) and the engine is handed the boundary whitespace plus the
  typed letters as a required prefix it masks every inconsistent token against, so the model finishes the word the
  user started; the normalizer shows only the untyped remainder. The word-count preset also bounds the result
  ([SuggestionLengthPolicy.swift](Ghostype/Support/Suggestion/Output/SuggestionLengthPolicy.swift) trims to the
  preset's upper bound at a clause boundary; the decoder's sentence stop waits for its lower bound).
- [SuggestionWorkController.swift](Ghostype/Services/Suggestion/State/SuggestionWorkController.swift):
  debounce/generation tasks and monotonically increasing work IDs.
- [SuggestionInteractionState.swift](Ghostype/Services/Suggestion/State/SuggestionInteractionState.swift):
  active session, materialized context, consumed prefix, and known post-insertion AX lag.
- [SuggestionStreamingState.swift](Ghostype/Support/Suggestion/Streaming/SuggestionStreamingState.swift): latest-wins
  partial coalescing, one scheduled drain, and monotonic rendered-text state.
- [PostExhaustionAcceptanceState.swift](Ghostype/Support/Suggestion/Session/PostExhaustionAcceptanceState.swift):
  pure state for the bounded Tab-ownership window while an exhausted tail regenerates.
- [SuggestionSessionReconciler.swift](Ghostype/Support/Suggestion/Session/SuggestionSessionReconciler.swift): type-through,
  acceptance, and live-host reconciliation.
- [SuggestionTextNormalizer.swift](Ghostype/Support/Suggestion/Output/SuggestionTextNormalizer.swift): backend-independent
  cleanup, echo removal, whitespace policy, trailing-text deduplication, word-boundary reconciliation, and
  unsafe-output rejection. [CompletionContentPolicy.swift](Ghostype/Support/Suggestion/Output/CompletionContentPolicy.swift)
  then drops punctuation-only output, closing punctuation after a typed space, forum/chat scaffolding or
  meta-responses about the prompt, a word sequence looping back to back, and text lifted verbatim from what the
  user just wrote.

A native correction path runs before model generation. NSSpellChecker and bundled SymSpell indexes
can suppress completion while a likely typo is forming, offer a green atomic replacement, or apply
an opt-in automatic fix after Space. A word the checker can still complete ("apprec") is treated as
in progress rather than misspelled, so the continuation finishes it.

Engines can stream cumulative partials. SuggestionStreamingState coalesces token-rate callbacks into
latest-wins UI work, accepts only monotonic extensions, and lets a displayed partial become an active
accept-ready session. The coordinator still owns scheduling and presentation. The final result
remains authoritative and can replace or suppress provisional text.

Normal sessions support exact type-through, word or phrase acceptance, full-tail acceptance, CJK-aware
segmentation, punctuation handling, optional trailing space, and speculative generation after final
acceptance. When rapid Tab presses cross the exhausted-tail regeneration gap,
PostExhaustionAcceptanceState can queue at most one unseen accept and has a generation-keyed backstop
that returns Tab ownership to the host. Corrections commit atomically rather than exposing partial
acceptance.

## Focus and Accessibility

Read:

1. [FocusTracker.swift](Ghostype/Services/Focus/FocusTracker.swift)
2. [FocusSnapshotResolver.swift](Ghostype/Services/Focus/Resolution/FocusSnapshotResolver.swift)
3. [FocusModels.swift](Ghostype/Models/Focus/FocusModels.swift)
4. [AXTextGeometryResolver.swift](Ghostype/Services/Focus/Resolution/AXTextGeometryResolver.swift)
5. [AXHelper.swift](Ghostype/Support/Accessibility/AXHelper.swift)

FocusTracker uses timer polling as the authoritative source because AX notifications are inconsistent
across AppKit, browsers, Electron, and custom editors. Activity resets the cadence; idle unchanged
state backs it off. Input and acceptance paths may request an explicit fresh capture, but do not trust
event payloads as complete field state.

FocusSnapshotResolver finds a usable editable candidate, blocks secure/unsupported surfaces (and
Mail's compose header rows, [MailHeaderFieldDetector.swift](Ghostype/Support/Accessibility/MailHeaderFieldDetector.swift):
Tab is the way from To to Subject to body there, not an accept; and single-line sign-in and
verification fields, [CredentialFieldDetector.swift](Ghostype/Support/Accessibility/CredentialFieldDetector.swift):
a completion there is a guess at the user's identity), bounds
text on both sides of the caret, resolves the focused process, and publishes stable domain values.
Chromium/Electron require accessibility priming, cursor hit-test recovery, and out-of-process iframe
handling. All fallbacks are revalidated and yield to a valid system-focused element.

AXTextGeometryResolver tries direct range bounds, browser text-marker bounds, a nearby measured
character, child static-text runs, and field-frame estimation. Geometry is labeled exact, derived,
estimated, or layoutEstimated; presentation uses that quality rather than pretending every rectangle
is equally trustworthy.

AX is synchronous cross-process IPC on MainActor. Deep walks are gated, cached, bounded, and
throttled. Calendar has a narrow capture guard because enumerating its transient editor can dismiss
the editor. Async consumers carry focus/content signatures instead of relying on AX element identity
alone.

## Global Input and Insertion

[InputMonitor.swift](Ghostype/Services/Input/InputMonitor.swift) owns three event-tap responsibilities:

- A steady listen-only observer for typing, deletion, navigation, and pointer activity.
- A conditional consuming tap while a suggestion or inline-command capture needs interception.
- A separate consuming tap for the configured global-toggle shortcut.

The conditional tap consumes a matching key only after the owning coordinator succeeds. Stale taps,
missing overlays, rejected sessions, and revoked permission fail open so the host receives the key.
Word/phrase and full-tail acceptance have independent configurable key/modifier bindings.

[InputSuppressionController.swift](Ghostype/Services/Input/InputSuppressionController.swift) marks and
counts Ghostype-generated events so insertion does not re-enter the typing pipeline.

[SuggestionInserter.swift](Ghostype/Services/Suggestion/SuggestionInserter.swift) normally posts short
Unicode key events without touching the clipboard. Active IME composition uses a clipboard paste
commit. A default-off policy can also paste long or multiline chunks. Paste tries the target app's
Accessibility Paste menu item before synthetic Command-V and restores every pasteboard representation
unless newer user clipboard activity wins.

Replacement sessions delete their validated literal run before inserting correction, emoji, or macro
text. Posting events is not treated as proof of success; the later AX snapshot is reconciled.

## Engines and Prompting

[SuggestionEngineRouter.swift](Ghostype/Services/Runtime/SuggestionEngineRouter.swift) selects one of:

- [FoundationModelSuggestionEngine.swift](Ghostype/Services/Runtime/AppleIntelligence/FoundationModelSuggestionEngine.swift)
  for Apple Intelligence. It uses the framework's instructions channel, streams cumulative partials,
  and keeps a one-use compatible prewarmed session. Unsupported language/locale can fall back to llama.
- [LlamaSuggestionEngine.swift](Ghostype/Services/Runtime/Llama/LlamaSuggestionEngine.swift) for an in-process
  GGUF base model through CotabbyInference. [LlamaRuntimeManager.swift](Ghostype/Services/Runtime/Llama/LlamaRuntimeManager.swift)
  publishes state; [LlamaRuntimeCore.swift](Ghostype/Services/Runtime/Llama/LlamaRuntimeCore.swift) owns native
  pointers, tokenization, KV-cache reuse, prefill, sampling, abort, and shutdown.
- [OpenAICompatibleSuggestionEngine.swift](Ghostype/Services/Runtime/OpenAICompatible/OpenAICompatibleSuggestionEngine.swift)
  for completion/chat APIs and SSE streams. The default is loopback Ollama at
  http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1; LAN and public HTTPS endpoints are supported, while insecure public HTTP
  is rejected.

LlamaRuntimeCore is a nonisolated lock/condition-protected native boundary, not a Swift actor. Its
autocomplete lock serializes cache/decode state, and its lifecycle condition prevents shutdown from
racing active native work. Heavy work runs away from MainActor.

The app and CotabbyInference intentionally expose one live autocomplete sequence. The package uses
one llama.cpp sequence slot and a changing external ID to reject stale work after a reset; the Swift
generation loop remains the single owner of the output-token budget.

Autocomplete heals the final prompt token when its printable bytes exactly match the text at the
caret. The native sampler replays those bytes under a vocabulary-prefix constraint, allowing a
longer token to finish an unfinished word without forcing every complete word to continue.
[TokenHealingBuffer.swift](Ghostype/Support/Runtime/TokenHealingBuffer.swift) removes replay bytes and
holds incomplete UTF-8 until it can publish lossless cumulative text. The extra replay allowance is
bounded separately from visible generation. Special tokens and oversized pieces take the ordinary
continuation path; no model weights or tokenizer files are modified.

Cache reuse is based on actual native restoration, not a permanent model-family blacklist. Ordinary
attention can trim its suffix; recurrent/hybrid or sliding-window memory uses one bounded partial
state checkpoint near the prompt tail, with at most eight tokens replayed. A miss falls back to a
cold prompt. Checkpoints live only in memory, are size-capped, and are cleared with the sequence.
Sampler history is rebuilt from the current prompt so discarded suggestions do not affect the next
request. Native memory may retain a generated tail between requests; the app tracks only the
validated prompt prefix and restores exactly the shared prefix before the next decode. Deferring
restoration avoids replaying the same tail both after generation and again on the next keystroke.
Cancellation targets a request identity as well as the native sequence, preventing a late
cancel from aborting a later request that reused the same sequence.

[BaseCompletionPromptRenderer.swift](Ghostype/Support/Prompting/BaseCompletionPromptRenderer.swift) renders a
base-model text continuation with optional budgeted context and the caret prefix last. It does not
wrap a base GGUF in an instruction conversation. The writer's name enters that preface only when
the caret follows a valediction ([SignOffCue.swift](Ghostype/Support/Prompting/SignOffCue.swift)):
named in every prompt, a base model introduced the writer at openings ("Hi, I'm Jacob"), addressed
them as the recipient, and copied the preface wording into the ghost; at a sign-off the name is the
one token wanted. The first-launch name is the Mac account's full name, never a placeholder. [FoundationModelPromptRenderer.swift](Ghostype/Support/Prompting/FoundationModelPromptRenderer.swift)
keeps Apple's instruction-shaped prompt separate.

The llama context window is 4096 tokens. `SuggestionConfiguration.derivedLlamaPromptTokenBudget`
subtracts the output ceiling and a safety margin from it, so the prompt budget (3982 tokens) can never
silently drift from the KV capacity the model actually has. The prefix caps (14000 characters / 2400
words) are sized to bind at roughly the same point: raising one without the other does nothing,
because whichever is smaller truncates the prefix to its tail and drops the early text that carries
the setup. Both were doubled together after the recall eval showed facts stated more than ~1900
tokens before the caret were invisible to the model.
The request window and section allocator preserve the prefix's spaces, line breaks, and indentation.
Multiline output cleanup also preserves the leading space needed to join a new word at the caret.
Bounded right-of-caret text is descriptive reference material before the prefix, not invented
fill-in-the-middle control tokens. This added suffix section is local-only: the endpoint renderer
does not receive it. Optional user-authored notes retain their existing budgets and settings; no
automatic writing-history collection is introduced.

Prewarm is opportunistic and goes only to the selected backend. Context reset reaches every backend.
The local runtime is loaded only for the Open Source engine and is released when switching to Apple
or endpoint mode so mapped weights and Metal buffers do not stay resident unnecessarily.

Two measurements happen at presentation time rather than in the focus resolver, because they read
the host's pixels (Screen Recording) and are asynchronous:

- [HostBaselineCalibrator.swift](Ghostype/Services/Presentation/HostBaselineCalibrator.swift) finds
  the painted baseline on the caret's line. A reading is accepted only if the letter bodies it was
  read from are the right size to be a line of this font (`describesPlausibleBodies`: body rows
  within 0.45x-1.35x the font's ascent) and the answer sits within the policy window; otherwise the
  policy baseline, the font's own metric, stands. Measured in a real session, one field's lines read
  12.0 and 15.0 for the same font: both passed the policy window, and the 12.0 lines put the ghost
  three points high. The gate is on the measurement, not a vote across lines: an earlier attempt to
  let one line's reading speak for the whole field adopted a bad first reading and made every line
  wrong instead of one.
- [PixelCaretLocator.swift](Ghostype/Services/Presentation/PixelCaretLocator.swift) places the caret
  inside a paragraph the host exposes only as one union-framed run with no answer to any bounds
  query (Obsidian's CodeMirror), and in a single-line field whose caret Accessibility could only
  estimate (Chrome's address bar answers every bounds query with a zero rect): there the field's
  frame is the line and the caret is where its ink ends, so the ghost goes inline instead of to the
  card. A single-line paragraph run gets the same treatment, read in its own line box widened to
  where its text now ends: its proportional caret landed 3pt off in Obsidian, and the full
  padding read its neighbours' ink as lines of its own. A capture cannot see the run under
  Ghostype's own ghost (the excluded window
  comes back black), so while the ghost is up a re-anchor for text typed since the run's last
  capture carries that caret forward by the typed advance (`extrapolatedMeasurement`), and
  anything else takes the ghost down for the read; re-anchoring to the Accessibility estimate
  instead put the ghost four lines up on every other keystroke.
  [InkCaretAnalyzer.swift](Ghostype/Support/Presentation/Geometry/InkCaretAnalyzer.swift)
  finds the inked lines in a capture of the run's frame; the caret is the end of the last line, the
  pitch is the distance between line tops, and the line box is the frame height less the pitch per
  extra line. Only a caret at the end of its paragraph is measured; a caret inside one keeps the
  card. `OverlayController` holds the first presentation for a paragraph text until the capture
  answers (tens of milliseconds) and reuses it for every later presentation of that text.

## Context, Privacy, and Permissions

[PermissionManager.swift](Ghostype/Services/Permission/PermissionManager.swift) tracks:

- Accessibility: required for focus, text, capability, geometry, and insertion validation.
- Input Monitoring: required for global keyboard observation and acceptance interception.
- Screen Recording: optional, used only for screenshot-derived context.

Context sources are independently enabled and bounded: recent AX prefix/trailing text, surface
metadata, user rules/extended context, relevant clipboard content, visual OCR, language, and settings.
[PromptContextSanitizer.swift](Ghostype/Support/Context/PromptContextSanitizer.swift) sanitizes optional text,
and prompt renderers apply per-section budgets.

Whether any of that context survives into the completion is measured, not assumed:
`GhostypeTests/Fixtures/llama-recall-cases.json` hides a fact in each context source (same-field text,
screen OCR, clipboard) and requires the completion to reproduce it. It is reported separately from the
continuation suite because averaging the two lets fluent prose hide a total failure to use context.

[ClipboardContextProvider.swift](Ghostype/Services/Context/ClipboardContextProvider.swift) reads a
fresh bounded value at request time rather than recording clipboard history. Relevance and distillation
policies drop unrelated or excessive content.

Visual context is one field-scoped session:

~~~text
VisualContextCoordinator
  -> WindowScreenshotService (local: focused window; endpoint: original field crop)
  -> ScreenTextExtractor (Vision OCR + line confidence)
  -> OCRTextHygiene
  -> VisualContextExcerptSelector (local: proximity, deduplication, reading order)
  -> bounded sanitized excerpt
~~~

There is no model summarization step and raw screenshots do not enter prompts. Missing Screen Recording
produces an explicit unavailable state without disabling text-only autocomplete. Debug screenshot/OCR
artifacts exist only under the explicit debug launch mode.

Local engines refresh context three seconds after the previous capture finishes, while generation
continues using the last ready excerpt. Every refresh rechecks focus, permissions and eligibility;
unchanged pixels reuse OCR and unchanged excerpts do not trigger generation. Local selection admits
up to 4,000 characters, additionally constrained by estimated-token budgets and caret-prefix priority.
The endpoint retains its original crop, focus-only lifecycle, 1,500-character excerpt and 500-character
prompt section. Increasing local context does not opt users into broader network transmission.
Local excerpts use confidence/line hygiene without the legacy English token whitelist, preserving
recognized names, ordinary words, dates and amounts instead of silently stripping them.

Secure fields cannot schedule generation, show a suggestion, accept text, or open an inline command,
so their context cannot flow into an engine request. VisualContextCoordinator also rejects secure
fields before starting screenshot/OCR work. FocusSnapshotResolver still creates a bounded AX context
before marking a secure field blocked; that lower-level acquisition remains separate privacy debt.

Endpoint credentials are stored in Keychain. A remote endpoint receives its bounded, legacy-scope
request; its privacy scope must remain visible in settings and documentation.

Typing history (Settings → Context → Typing History) is the one store of the user's writing that
outlives its field. Both of its switches are off by default. When recording is on,
`TypingHistoryStore` keeps the text of fields where Ghostype is active (the same
`SuggestionAvailabilityEvaluator` rule as suggestions; never secure fields, terminals, or excluded
apps), one record per piece of writing (a chat composer that clears after sending yields one record
per message), scrubs secret-like tokens and card numbers (`TypingHistoryScrubber`), and seals the
archive with AES-GCM under a Keychain key that never syncs (`TypingHistoryVault`). Nothing is
written until something is recorded or imported. Delete All removes the file and the key. A Cotypist
`user_inputs.json` export can be imported. Only text that was before the caret is learned from,
because the rest of a field is often a quoted thread. History shapes suggestions in two ways:
`TypingHistoryIndex` adds two short passages of similar past writing to the prompt, and
`TypingHistoryPhraseEngine` answers from `TypingHistoryPhrasePredictor` when history confidently
knows how a phrase ends. Both are on-device only: the provider returns nothing
for the endpoint, the request factory drops examples for it, and the router refuses to send any
request that still carries them.

## Presentation and Sibling Features

[SuggestionOverlayPresenter.swift](Ghostype/Services/Suggestion/SuggestionOverlayPresenter.swift)
decides presentation actions. [OverlayController.swift](Ghostype/Services/Presentation/OverlayController.swift)
owns a reusable borderless non-activating NSPanel and SwiftUI-hosted content.

Automatic presentation uses inline ghost text for exact/derived caret geometry and a mirror card for
estimated/layout-estimated geometry, mid-line editing, or explicit user preference. The overlay can
match host font/color, render corrections distinctly, respect right-to-left and multiline layout,
show an acceptance hint, and advance a partial tail without waiting for noisy AX geometry.

Inline ghost text is built to occupy the pixels the accepted text will occupy:

- [GhostFontResolver.swift](Ghostype/Support/Presentation/Style/GhostFontResolver.swift) picks the
  host's face and size from the field's reported style, from a measured width sample
  ([HostTextMetricsProbe.swift](Ghostype/Services/Focus/Resolution/HostTextMetricsProbe.swift); a host
  that answers no width query gets one from how far its caret moves as the user types,
  [CaretAdvanceSampler.swift](Ghostype/Support/Focus/CaretAdvanceSampler.swift), because a Chromium
  size is CSS pixels that know nothing of page or Electron zoom: the Claude composer reported 14
  and painted 15.4), or from the host's own pixels
  ([TypefaceMatcher.swift](Ghostype/Support/Presentation/Style/TypefaceMatcher.swift))
  when the host names no face. Every capture is snapped to whole device pixels first: a fractional
  edge makes ScreenCaptureKit resample the image and the blurred glyphs correlate with nothing. The pixel match searches size as well as face (a caret-box size is
  a guess: Obsidian's 16px body arrived as 17 and 20, and a face matched at the wrong size is
  confidently wrong), carries every candidate to its exact size (the correlation drops from 0.95
  to 0.66 a sixth of a point away, and a wrong face at a lucky size outscores the true face at a
  grid point), marks down a candidate whose letter bodies are not the height the host
  painted, prefers the system face on a near tie, and declines on too little ink. The size it
  keeps is then fitted to the host's glyph positions alone, the chosen face rendered once and
  stretched about the caret (`advanceFitted`): shape scoring picked Chrome's 18px Georgia at
  18.054, a ghost two device pixels long by a line's end, while the positions put it at 18. An
  Electron host's own bundled faces join the candidates
  ([HostBundledFontRegistry.swift](Ghostype/Services/Presentation/HostBundledFontRegistry.swift)
  registers its TrueType/OpenType files for this process alone), which is how Claude's composer
  can be drawn in Anthropic Sans rather than a stand-in. The calibrator
  keeps one record per field, replaced only when a later strip's winner beats the recorded face on
  that same strip; scores from different strips are not comparable. A reported size stands when the
  caret box is shorter than its glyphs (VS Code's hidden textarea reports 8.5pt boxes for 14pt text).
- [GhostBaselinePolicy.swift](Ghostype/Support/Presentation/Geometry/GhostBaselinePolicy.swift) places
  the baseline the way TextKit or Blink/WebKit would inside the caret box;
  [HostBaselineCalibrator.swift](Ghostype/Services/Presentation/HostBaselineCalibrator.swift) measures a
  web host's painted baseline from a small screen capture (Screen Recording permitting) to recover
  the sub-point line position Accessibility rounds away.
- [GhostTextLayout.swift](Ghostype/Support/Presentation/Geometry/GhostTextLayout.swift) lays rows out
  from the caret with CTTypesetter inside the band
  [GhostWrapBandPolicy.swift](Ghostype/Support/Presentation/Geometry/GhostWrapBandPolicy.swift) derives
  from the element's real frame, one row per host line at the measured line pitch (the probe scans
  single-character bounds for the nearest other line when a host's line APIs give none, as Chromium's
  do; sibling text runs give it for CodeMirror; the caret box height stands in until a field has a
  second line). A row is never placed over the host's own text: with the host's lines below the
  caret the ghost keeps to the caret row and reveals the rest as it is accepted, and a caret with
  characters after it on its line gets the card under the caret from
  [CompletionRenderModePolicy.swift](Ghostype/Support/Presentation/Policy/CompletionRenderModePolicy.swift)
  (an opaque band in the field's background color was tried and read as the suggestion overwriting
  the user's text). Accepted or typed-through text only advances a consumed offset, so remaining
  glyphs never move. [GhostTextPanelView.swift](Ghostype/Services/Presentation/GhostTextPanelView.swift)
  draws the rows with CoreText on a whole-point panel origin.
- While the host shows uncommitted text of its own (macOS inline predictive text, an IME
  composition; [HostMarkedTextPolicy.swift](Ghostype/Support/Input/HostMarkedTextPolicy.swift)) the
  coordinator holds: no generation, no ghost, session kept. Chromium's address bar completes inline
  and leaves the completion selected; the resolver strips that selection from the text and treats
  the completion as the host's marked text, so the hold covers it too and its ink is never read as
  the caret line's end.
- Editors that expose a whole wrapped paragraph as one text run (CodeMirror in Obsidian) get their
  caret from a layout of that paragraph inside the run's own frame at the sibling runs' pitch
  (`WrappedRunAnchor`, laid out by
  [TextLayoutCaretEstimator.swift](Ghostype/Support/Presentation/Geometry/TextLayoutCaretEstimator.swift)
  in the coordinator's repair step); whitespace-only spacer runs never anchor the caret mapping.

[ActivationIndicatorController.swift](Ghostype/Services/Presentation/ActivationIndicatorController.swift) owns
the optional field/caret indicator. [FocusDebugOverlayController.swift](Ghostype/Services/Presentation/FocusDebugOverlayController.swift)
is developer-only and gated by -ghostype-debug.

[InlineCommandCoordinator.swift](Ghostype/App/Coordinators/InlineFeatures/InlineCommandCoordinator.swift) arbitrates
the single input-capture slot between:

- [EmojiPickerController.swift](Ghostype/App/Coordinators/InlineFeatures/EmojiPickerController.swift): colon query,
  lazy catalog/matcher, non-activating picker, recency/frequency ranking, and literal-run replacement.
- [MacroController.swift](Ghostype/App/Coordinators/InlineFeatures/MacroController.swift): slash query and deterministic
  date, random, unit, currency, and arithmetic evaluation through MacroEngine.

Both use pure trigger state machines, stay pinned to one supported focus sequence, and cancel on
focus change or incompatible input. They do not call a language model.

[SettingsCoordinator.swift](Ghostype/App/Coordinators/SettingsCoordinator.swift) and
[WelcomeCoordinator.swift](Ghostype/App/Coordinators/WelcomeCoordinator.swift) own app-lifetime AppKit
windows hosting SwiftUI content. Settings and onboarding observe the shared graph. Hiding the menu bar
icon retains a recovery path to Settings.

## Concurrency and Reliability Rules

- Revalidate after every await that can outlive focus, content, settings, or work identity.
- Treat cancellation as expected lifecycle, not automatically as a backend failure.
- Keep AX and AppKit access MainActor-isolated, but bound synchronous AX work aggressively.
- Use actors or explicit serialization for mutable non-UI state; do not move native pointers across
  an ownership boundary casually.
- Never use only AX element identity as a stale-result guard.
- Keep overlay text and active-session remaining text equal before acceptance.
- Preserve the narrow known-insertion sentinel; general stale AX tolerance hides real divergence.
- Stop new generation and input work before releasing runtime state at termination.

## Safe Change Order

When behavior changes, prefer:

1. Pure policy and helpers in Support.
2. Domain values, state, settings, and contracts in Models.
3. Side-effectful boundaries in Services.
4. Orchestration in App.
5. Presentation in UI.

This is a dependency direction, not a demand to touch every layer. A pure rule should not be added to
SuggestionCoordinator just because that is where its symptom becomes visible.

## Debugging and Validation

Development schemes launch with -ghostype-debug. That enables local privacy-sensitive diagnostics in
addition to unified logging:

- ~/Library/Logs/Ghostype/cotabby.jsonl: structured event stream.
- ~/Library/Logs/Ghostype/llm-io.jsonl: full prompt/completion records.
- ~/Desktop/cotabby-ax-dump.txt: most recent Chrome focus AX tree.
- ~/Desktop/cotabby-debug-screenshots/: retained visual-context capture/OCR pairs.

Every prediction carries a request_id through coordinator, router, engine, and LLM-I/O records. Start
with category focus for field/geometry failures, suggestion for state/acceptance failures, runtime for
model failures, and app for permissions/lifecycle.

[project.yml](project.yml) is the Xcode project source of truth. XcodeGen produces the committed
[Ghostype.xcodeproj](Ghostype.xcodeproj); CI regenerates it and fails when the checked-in project differs.
Debug and Release build the same Ghostype app identity, preference domain, icon, and model storage.
The Debug configuration exposes General > Development > Show Development Debug Overlays (off by
default); AppDelegate forwards that live preference to the presentation controller and polling
diagnostics. The `-ghostype-debug` launch argument controls local diagnostic logging independently.
Keep the signing identity consistent across builds to preserve macOS permission grants.
Swift default actor isolation is MainActor.

Use the narrowest relevant tests first, then broaden. The standard build boundary is:

~~~bash
xcodebuild -project Ghostype.xcodeproj -scheme Ghostype -destination 'platform=macOS' build \
  -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData

xcodebuild -project Ghostype.xcodeproj -scheme Ghostype -destination 'platform=macOS' build-for-testing \
  -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData
~~~

CI independently checks project generation, compilation, tests, and SwiftLint. Pure state machines,
policies, prompt utilities, normalization, and layout logic should receive focused unit coverage.

## Problem-to-File Map

| Symptom or change | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| App startup, duplicate service, shutdown | CotabbyAppEnvironment, AppDelegate |
| Field not detected or wrong app policy | FocusTracker, FocusSnapshotResolver |
| Ghost at wrong location | AXTextGeometryResolver, CompletionRenderModePolicy, OverlayController |
| Suggestion never starts | SuggestionAvailabilityEvaluator, SuggestionCoordinator+Prediction |
| Old suggestion appears | SuggestionWorkController, focus/content signatures |
| Wrong prompt or leaked optional context | SuggestionRequestFactory, prompt renderer, sanitizer |
| Backend selection or memory issue | SuggestionEngineRouter, AppDelegate, LlamaRuntimeManager |
| Native decode/cache/shutdown issue | LlamaRuntimeCore, CotabbyInference boundary |
| Partial/final output mismatch | streaming policy, SuggestionTextNormalizer, seam guards |
| Rapid Tab leaks to the host after exhausting a tail | PostExhaustionAcceptanceState, acceptance coordinator |
| Acceptance key passes through or is stolen | InputMonitor, acceptance validation |
| Wrong or repeated inserted text | SuggestionInserter, InputSuppressionController, reconciler |
| Clipboard context is irrelevant | ClipboardRelevanceFilter, ClipboardContentDistiller |
| Screenshot context is stale/noisy | VisualContextCoordinator, OCRTextHygiene |
| Emoji or macro conflicts with suggestions | InlineCommandCoordinator, feature trigger machine |
| Permission loop or lost grant | PermissionManager, PermissionGuidanceController, app identity |
| Settings/onboarding window issue | SettingsCoordinator, WelcomeCoordinator |
| Settings persistence or domain mismatch | SuggestionSettingsModel, SuggestionSettingsData, SuggestionSettingsStore |

When a change crosses several rows, keep ownership at these boundaries rather than teaching one
coordinator to perform every step itself.
