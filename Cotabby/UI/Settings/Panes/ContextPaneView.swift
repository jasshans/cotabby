/// File overview:
/// "Context" detail pane of the Settings window. It leads with a live preview: a real, native text
/// field that the running app completes in exactly as it does anywhere else. Typing in it drives the
/// production focus -> suggestion -> overlay pipeline end to end, so the gray suggestion, Tab to
/// accept, and Esc to dismiss are the real thing, not an in-app reimplementation. Below it sits the
/// Extended Context editor (a free-form blob folded into every prompt) with its cost warning
/// co-located, then a short "how this is used" note.
///
/// Why the field is real (the redesign):
/// the preview previously hand-rolled an `NSTextView` that mirrored a SwiftUI binding and rendered a
/// ghost run inside its own editable storage. That reconciliation raced with live keystrokes and
/// corrupted typed text, so the box felt unnatural to type in. The field is now plain and inert:
/// `FocusTracker` lifts its "never complete in our own UI" rule for this one element (keyed on
/// `ContextLivePreview.accessibilityIdentifier`), and the real overlay draws the suggestion at the
/// caret. The text view owns its string outright, so nothing competes with the user's typing.
///
/// Why a dedicated pane (not Writing): the Writing pane carries name and language personalization.
/// Extended Context is a different shape (long-form, free markdown, and noticeably more expensive on
/// the token budget), so it keeps its own pane with room for the cost-of-use warning.
///
/// The Extended Context editor binds through `SuggestionSettingsModel.setExtendedContext`, which
/// length-caps the value on write. Whitespace is intentionally NOT trimmed in the setter so the user
/// can type a trailing space; `SuggestionRequestFactory` does the once-per-request trim instead.
