# Ghostype Source Layout

This document is the canonical placement map for production and test source files. It complements
`ARCHITECTURE.md`, which explains runtime ownership and data flow.

Swift folders do not create namespaces. Every Swift file discovered under `Ghostype/` still compiles
into the application module, and every file under `GhostypeTests/` compiles into the test module.
Folders exist so a maintainer can predict where a responsibility lives before searching.

## Placement Rules

1. Choose the top-level architectural boundary first: `App`, `UI`, `Services`, `Models`, or
   `Support`.
2. Choose the product subsystem next, such as `Suggestion`, `Focus`, `Runtime`, or `Settings`.
3. Keep a small cohesive subsystem flat.
4. Add a child folder only when at least two files form a stable responsibility with a predictable
   name. Do not create one-file folders merely to shorten a file list.
5. Put a direct unit test under the corresponding `GhostypeTests/` responsibility. Cross-cutting
   coordinator tests may remain grouped by the coordinator they exercise.
6. Folder moves must not change Swift access control, runtime ownership, or target membership.
   XcodeGen discovers the new paths; regenerate `Ghostype.xcodeproj` after moving files.

Files left directly inside a subsystem are intentionally its root owners or a small cohesive set.
For example, `SuggestionEngineRouter.swift` remains at `Services/Runtime/` because it coordinates all
three backend folders, while `FocusTracker.swift` remains at `Services/Focus/` because it owns the
whole focus lifecycle rather than one resolution or caching technique.

## Test Tree

`GhostypeTests/` mirrors the production responsibility after removing the leading `Ghostype/`. For
example:

~~~text
Ghostype/Support/Suggestion/Output/SuggestionTextNormalizer.swift
GhostypeTests/Support/Suggestion/Output/SuggestionTextNormalizerTests.swift

Ghostype/Services/Runtime/Llama/LlamaSuggestionEngine.swift
GhostypeTests/Services/Runtime/Llama/LlamaSuggestionEngineStreamingTests.swift

Ghostype/App/Coordinators/Suggestion/SuggestionCoordinator.swift
GhostypeTests/App/Coordinators/Suggestion/SuggestionCoordinatorPredictionTests.swift
~~~

Tests that exercise several production values may stay at the nearest shared subsystem root. Evals
remain under `GhostypeTests/Evals`, and shared fixtures remain under `GhostypeTests/TestSupport`.

## Unfinished-Word Interaction

- `Support/Suggestion/Request/CaretWordContext.swift` distinguishes a still-typed token from a
  delimiter-committed word. `TypoGate` and the correction replacement planner consume this value;
  pausing alone never makes correction eligible.
- `Support/Suggestion/Output/CompletionSeamGuard.swift` returns the same presentation decision for
  streamed and final output: wait for the first word, reject a malformed join, show a word ending,
  or show a phrase. A recognized completed word keeps its following phrase even from a one-letter
  prefix; unknown names and jargon can still show a conservative word ending.
- `Support/Suggestion/Request/SuggestionRequestFactory.swift` applies the optional
  `suggestWithinWords` preference to new ordinary and speculative requests. The completion settings
  domain persists the choice, while active sessions remain free to follow matching typing.
- `Services/Suggestion/State/SuggestionInteractionState.swift` holds a narrow range of typed
  characters awaiting Accessibility publication. `SuggestionSessionReconciler` tolerates only an
  older matching prefix during this handoff, so a typed space preserves the following words without
  treating unrelated edits as acceptance. Correction sessions never participate in type-through.
- `Models/Suggestion/Session/ActiveSuggestionSession.swift` separates the full prediction from
  the visible acceptance boundary. An uncertain word ending can retain following words without
  offering them early. The `showFollowingWords` completion preference uses the same boundary to
  show one word at a time; even full acceptance inserts only the current visible offer. Matching
  typing consumes the buffered prediction, while streaming may extend it without revising it.
- `Support/Suggestion/Session/SuggestionContinuationPlan.swift` constructs hypothetical completed
  or corrected text and its exact publication target. A virtual separating space asks for the
  next words rather than another ending; it never edits the host field. The coordinator's
  `+Continuation.swift` owns one cancellable lookahead and attaches it to a terminal word ending,
  or holds it behind a correction until the editor publishes that correction. The live context
  buffer remains anchored to observed text throughout this work.
  Additional preaccept lookahead is limited to on-device engines; configured endpoints retain
  already-generated phrases but do not receive the new hypothetical-edit requests.
- `Support/Spelling/WordPrefixIndex.swift` supplies immutable exact-prefix candidates and bounded
  document/glossary vocabulary. `SymSpellCorrector` builds its index on the existing background
  dictionary queue; fallback never uses spelling edit distance or changes typed letters.
- `Support/Suggestion/Streaming/TypingCadence.swift` measures recent inter-letter intervals and
  controls presentation timing independently of generation debounce. `SuggestionStreamingState`
  memoizes exact-word checks and closes the stream when a final result arrives.
- `Support/Suggestion/Streaming/TypingPredictionCandidate.swift` tracks matching typed characters
  against one on-device request and validates their exact Accessibility publication before rebasing
  the remaining text. `SuggestionCoordinator+TypingPrediction.swift` owns that candidate and its
  expiry timer. The default-on `predictAheadWhileTyping` setting controls retention independently
  of streaming display; disabling it cancels retained work through the settings snapshot lifecycle.
- `Support/Suggestion/Session/SuggestionDismissalMemory.swift` remembers explicit dismissal for at
  most 15 seconds in the same field and text context. It is bounded and never persisted.
- `App/Coordinators/Suggestion/SuggestionCoordinator+WordCompletion.swift` adapts these pure values
  to the existing spell checker, dictionaries, settings, and cancellable presentation work.

Direct tests mirror those folders. `SuggestionCoordinatorWordCompletionTests` replays pauses after
individual letters, malformed streams, fallback acceptance, dismissal/cache behavior, and cancellation
against the actual coordinator with synthetic OS and engine boundaries. The phrase accuracy replay
uses the committed typo gate and final display policy, but deliberately excludes local fallback so
its score remains attributable to the model. Timing replay and coordinator interaction tests cover
presentation and acceptance separately; model-only scores do not represent the complete experience.
`SuggestionCoordinatorContinuityTests` covers buffered acceptance, hidden streaming growth, cached
word restoration, correction publication, and late cancellation. `TypingExperienceEvalTests` drives
the production coordinator with the real local engine and a synthetic editor, recording visible
and buffered text plus actual requests in `build/eval/typing-experience.json`. It does not measure
third-party editor AX behavior or visual placement.

## Adding Or Moving A File

1. Identify its single dominant responsibility using the map above.
2. Place or move its direct tests with it conceptually.
3. Update tracked Markdown links and any scripts containing physical paths.
4. Run `xcodegen generate` and commit the regenerated project.
5. Run SwiftLint, a build, and `build-for-testing` before opening a pull request.

When a file seems to fit several folders, that usually signals either a cross-subsystem contract
that belongs in `Models`, a root orchestrator that should remain above its collaborators, or a type
that owns too many responsibilities and should be split by behavior rather than hidden by nesting.

## Conversation Context Freshness

- `Support/Focus/FocusedInputPollingSignature.swift` distinguishes navigation using live URL, title,
  placeholder and field geometry, while ignoring typing and volatile AX wrapper tokens. The focus
  resolver reads these facts before comparing sessions; surface metadata is not frozen in a cache.
- `FocusedInputSessionIdentity` in `Models/Focus/FocusModels.swift` carries that boundary through
  generation, acceptance and speculative work. Prediction memory has a session key separate from
  the geometry/style key so another conversation cannot restore an old suggestion.
- `VisualContextCoordinator` refreshes both backend profiles using their existing capture limits.
  Excerpts expire six seconds after capture starts, even while OCR is pending. Navigation clears
  the published excerpt immediately, and invalidation retires predictions conditioned on it.
